        Ships and offshore structures are sometimes subjected to accidental situations compromising their structural integrity. The challenge in failure modelling structures of such size is usually the compromise between the computational effort and accuracy of models and simulations. In this regard, the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) of shell elements is presented as an interesting avenue for application. The successful utilization of XFEM however requires considerable development before it is ready for engineering practice. This presentation will therefore aim to elaborate and shed the light on the following question. How is it possible to accurately and efficiently model large ship and offshore structures up to failure? My current work is on developing the traction separation law necessary for XFEM a priori based on material properties, stress states and boundary conditions rather than a posteriori.

        Submarine power cables have been involved with different failures during service, especially for the dynamic power cable, which suffers different loadings from currents, waves and the movements of platforms. The presentation is aimed to introduce the basic idea and method to predict the mechanical behaviour of dynamic power cables under the common loadings such as tension, torsion and bending. The research proceeds from a local smaller cross section to a bigger overall cross section of the cable by using a special RUC (repeated unit cell) finite element model considering the complexity of the structure. The audiences will get a basic idea about the mechanical study of an ocean structure and some interesting tests Iâ€™ve done regarding a real submarine power cable.

      <h3><b>Design rationale capturing and reuse in early stage complex ship design</b></h3>

        Complex ships, such as naval vessels and large service vessels, are characterized by a constantly changing design landscape, due to endogenous, exogenous, and temporal factors. Also, the design process involves many stakeholders with various perspectives and preferences. Concept designs are an essential product of early stage complex ship design activities, for instance to inform stakeholders on potential conflicts between requirements and preferences and to evaluate technical feasibility and affordability. Hence, many design decisions involve uncertainty and might be revisited at a later stage. At the same time, design rationale behind these decisions is not always captured (well). This complicates the reconsideration of past decisions. To enhance this situation, some key challenges (e.g. intrusiveness in the design process and cost-benefit balance) to design rationale capturing need to be resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The integration of on-the-fly design rationale capturing and reuse, and design work is proposed as a solution to overcome these challenges.
        The presentation will elaborate on 1) the problem, and 2) the solution, while aiming to increase the awareness of that ships are the product of very diverse, yet highly interrelated design aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        How important are your design considerations to the overall design, and how would you convey that to other design disciplines?
